### Project Title
Bike Share Statistical Data 

### Description
In this project, I Used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The script can be used to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I have also written a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics based on city, months, days.
